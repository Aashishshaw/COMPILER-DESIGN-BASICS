  QUE1 : This project is a simple lexical analyzer written in the C programming language. Its primary objective is to read a source code file (input.txt), break the content into meaningful lexical units called tokens, and classify these tokens as keywords, identifiers, operators, numbers, or special characters. This process is an essential first step in the compilation of any programming language and forms the foundation of a compilerâ€™s front end.

The lexical analyzer was developed using the C language due to its low-level capabilities, efficient memory handling, and close interaction with system-level functions such as file handling and character manipulation. The code uses standard C libraries like stdio.h, string.h, and ctype.h for input/output operations, string processing, and character classification. It was compiled using the GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) and tested on a Windows platform through the Code::Blocks IDE. Alternatively, it can be run on Linux systems or online compilers like OnlineGDB or JDoodle.

The key logic of the analyzer includes reading each character from the file, grouping characters into tokens based on syntax rules, and then applying conditions to identify the type of each token. Keywords are identified using a predefined array; operators and special symbols are matched character by character; and numeric literals are distinguished using digit checks.

This program is especially useful for educational purposes, helping students understand how compilers begin interpreting source code. It also serves as a stepping stone toward more complex compiler modules like syntax and semantic analyzers.
